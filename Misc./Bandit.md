# Bandit
Bandit is a wargame made for beginners to get them started on how to play wargames. [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

## Level 0
We need to create a ssh link between the site and our terminal so we do that by entering `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` where "bandit0" is the username, then its followed by the domain that we need to connect to and `-p` is used to connect to the specified port "2220" and finally it will ask for the password. 
> password: "bandit0" 

## Level 1
We need to read the "readme" file to get the password for the next level so we just use `cat readme` to do that. 
> password: "ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If"

## Level 2
We need to read the "-" file to get the password for next level so we do that by using `cat ./-` (we add "./" since "-" is a special character so it assumes its there to give an argument). 
> password: "263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx"

## Level 3
We need to read the file "spaces in this filename" to get the flag, since we cant enter this file name directly in the command due to the space, I used the help of "Tab" key what i did was enter `cat space` and clicked "Tab" it auto filled the command to read the only available file starting with "spac" and thus the command i finally got was `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename` which worked and i got the password.

## Level 4
We need to go to the directory "inhere" and find the hidden file so we do `cd inhere` and use `ls -a` to see all files, we find the file is "...Hiding-From-You" so we read it by using `cat ...Hiding-From-You` and get the password.
> password: "2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ"

## Level 5
We need to go to the directory "inhere" and read the correct file to get the password so just read all of them one by one and we find that `cat ./-file07` had the password. We could also just check what type of content is in each file using `file` since only the correct file is human readable and find the correct one and then read it.
> password: "4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw"

## Level 6
We need to go to the directory "inhere" and read the correct file to get the password but we know few details about the correct file, we know that it has a size of "1033" bytes so we use the `du` command, it tells us the size of files and directories so we use the command `du -abl`(a is to get the size of ALL files and directoies, b is the convert the size into bytes and l is to print them in a list format) to get the file sizes of all the files in all the directories in "inhere" but there are alot of files here so we use `grep` to find the file by using the command `du -alb | grep 1033`, finally we find the file is `./maybehere07/.file2` so read it by using `cat  ./maybehere07/.file2` and get the password.
